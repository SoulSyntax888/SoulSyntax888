- 👋 Hi, I’m @SoulSyntax888
- 👀 I’m interested in integrating ancient wisdom, technology, and human psychology to create a regenerative, decentralised society that thrives in harmony with nature. 
- ❤️‍🔥 I'm passoinate about leadership development, integral and depth psychology, systems theory, music production, and exploring consciousness. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, python, mixing music, and exploring Ken Wilber's work
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that bridge personal development with collective transformation, or creative ventures that merge tech, storytelling and personal development.
